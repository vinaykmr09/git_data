What is git cherry-pick?
git cherry-pick is a command used to copy a specific commit from one branch and apply it to another branch.

It doesn’t bring the entire branch history — it only copies the changes made in the selected commit(s).

Real-life Example:
Let’s say you fixed a bug in a branch called feature-x, and now you want that exact fix (commit) to appear in master branch without merging the full branch.

You can just:
git checkout master
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
Command Format
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
You can find commit hashes using:
git log --oneline
Step-by-step Example:
Step 1: Check out the branch you want to apply the commit to
git checkout master

# Step 2: Cherry-pick the commit from another branch
git cherry-pick 1a2b3c4
Now, Git will apply the changes from commit 1a2b3c4 to your current branch (master).

Merge Conflict during Cherry-pick?
Sometimes cherry-pick results in conflicts, especially if:

The same file was modified in both branches

The context of the commit doesn’t match the target branch

What to do?
Git will pause and show a conflict:
error: could not apply 1a2b3c4... Fix bug in auth flow
Open the conflicted files (e.g. story-index.txt)

Manually resolve the conflict and keep the correct content

After fixing:
git add <file>
git cherry-pick --continue
Undo Cherry-pick
If you cherry-picked by mistake, you can undo it (if not pushed yet):
git cherry-pick --abort         # if in middle of cherry-pick
git reset --hard HEAD~1         # if you want to undo the last cherry-pick commit
Cherry-pick vs Merge vs Rebase
Command	Purpose
merge	Bring all commits from one branch into another
rebase	Move your branch commits onto another branch
cherry-pick	Bring specific commit(s) into your branch
Use Cases of git cherry-pick
Scenario	Why cherry-pick is useful
Hotfix	Apply a bug fix from dev to production without merging the whole branch
Roll forward	Bring a single missing commit into a release
Isolated change	You only need one commit, not the full feature
Summary
Command	Purpose
git cherry-pick <hash>	Apply a specific commit to current branch
git cherry-pick --continue	Continue after resolving conflict
git cherry-pick --abort	Cancel cherry-pick in progress
