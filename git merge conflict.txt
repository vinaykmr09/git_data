What is a Merge Conflict?
A merge conflict happens when:

Two people change the same part of the same file in different branches, and Git can’t automatically decide which change to keep.

Example:
Max updated line 5 in story.txt and pushed it.

You also updated line 5 in your local story.txt.

When you pull or merge his changes, Git doesn’t know which version to keep — that’s a conflict.

How do you resolve a conflict?
Git marks the conflict in the file like this:
<<<<<<< HEAD
your changes
=======
Max's changes
>>>>>>> origin/master
You have to manually edit the file, pick the correct content, and then:
git add filename
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
Why do you need to pull before pushing?
You should always pull before pushing to avoid conflicts.

Here’s why:
Someone (like Max) might have pushed changes to the master branch.

If you try to push without pulling, your version is out of sync.

Git will reject your push until your branch is synced.

Workflow:
git pull origin master    # Get latest changes
# Resolve conflicts if any
git push origin master    # Now push your changes
What does this output mean?
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 3 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
Explanation:
You’re on the master branch

You have made 3 local commits that haven’t been pushed yet

nothing to commit → Your local files are already saved and staged

Now you can push safely:
git push origin master
What does git log origin/master do?
This command shows you the commit history of the remote master branch, not your local one.

If your local master is ahead, you’ll see fewer commits in origin/master than in git log.

Quick Recap
Task	Command	Notes
Pull remote changes	git pull origin master	Always do this before pushing
Push local commits	git push origin master	After your branch is up to date
Check remote commit log	git log origin/master	View remote branch history
Check your own commit log	git log	See local commits
Resolve conflicts	Manual edit → git add → git commit	Git can’t always auto-merge
