What is git push to a Remote Repository?
git push is used to send your local commits (changes) to a remote repository, like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
Example:
git push origin master
origin is the name of the remote.

master is the branch you're pushing.

This command updates the remote repository with your latest commits from your local repo.

Try to Commit the Changes
If you made a change (like adding a new story file), you can commit it like this:
git add .
git commit -m "Added fox-and-grapes story"
But if Git doesn't know who you are, you may get this error:
Please tell me who you are.
This means Git needs your identity (username and email) to tag the commit.

Fix Git Identity (Who You Are)
Tell Git who you are using the following commands:
git config user.name "Max"
git config user.email "max@example.com"
These commands set the name and email for the current repository only.

To set it globally for all repos:
git config --global user.name "Max"
git config --global user.email "max@example.com"
You can check what’s set using:
git config --list
How to Create a Git User (in GitLab or GitHub)
If you’re asking how to create a new user account on platforms like GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket:

Go to the website (e.g., https://gitlab.com or https://github.com)

Click Sign Up

Enter your email, username, and password

Confirm your email to activate the account

That’s it — now you have your own Git user account.
