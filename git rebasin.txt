What is Git Rebase?
Rebasing is a Git operation used to:

Move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit.

Create a cleaner, linear commit history (unlike merge which creates "branches").

In simple words:
git rebase helps you re-write history as if your changes were made on top of the latest commit of another branch (usually master or main).

Why Use Rebase?
Why use Rebase?	What it helps with
Clean and readable history	No "merge commits" clutter
Make sure your feature branch is up to date	Especially before merging into main/master
Fix messy commit logs	Combine, reorder, rename, or delete commits
Command Breakdown
git rebase master
This rebases your current branch on top of the latest master branch.

Use case:
You are working on a feature branch feature-x, but master has new commits.
git checkout feature-x
git rebase master
This makes your commits appear as if you started work after the latest commit on master.

git rebase -i HEAD~3
This opens an interactive rebase for the last 3 commits on your current branch.

You can:

pick (keep as-is)

reword (change commit message)

edit (pause to make changes)

squash (combine commits)

drop (remove a commit)

Example:
git rebase -i HEAD~3
You’ll see something like:
pick 1a2b3c4 Added login page
pick 2b3c4d5 Fixed login button
pick 3c4d5e6 Improved login error message
You can change it to:
pick 1a2b3c4 Added login page
squash 2b3c4d5 Fixed login button
squash 3c4d5e6 Improved login error message
This will combine all 3 into 1 commit with a custom commit message.

git rebase -i
Same as above, but you can define how many commits to look back. Use:
git rebase -i HEAD~N
Where N = number of commits to look back.

Rebase vs Merge (in short)
Feature	git merge	git rebase
History	Keeps all branches and merge commits	Linear and cleaner history
Conflict Risk	Less, since it keeps history intact	More, since it rewrites history
Use When	Collaboration, no need for clean history	Cleaning history before pushing
Important Notes Before Using Rebase
Never rebase a branch that others are using unless everyone agrees.

Rebase rewrites history, so be careful when working with shared branches.

Always pull with --rebase or rebase your local branch before creating a pull request.

Bonus: Pull with Rebase
git pull --rebase origin master
This makes your local commits apply on top of the latest remote commits, just like rebase.
