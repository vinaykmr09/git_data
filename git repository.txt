What is a Local and Remote Repository?
Local Repository
A local Git repository is the one on your own system.

You use Git commands like git init, git commit, git branch, etc., in this local environment.

All files, commits, and branches are stored on your machine.

Remote Repository
A remote repository is hosted on a server or platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

It is used to collaborate with others, share code, or keep a backup of your code online.

Remote repositories are usually hosted at:

https://github.com/username/repo.git

https://gitlab.com/groupname/project.git

You use git push, git pull, and git fetch to sync changes between local and remote repositories.

What is a Connection String in Git?
A connection string (also called a remote URL) is the address of the remote Git repository. It tells your local Git repo where to push or pull code from.

There are two common formats:

HTTPS URL:
https://github.com/username/repo.git

SSH URL (more secure, used with SSH keys):
git@github.com:username/repo.git

This connection string is used in git remote add and other commands.

What is GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket?
These are cloud platforms that host Git repositories. They allow individuals and teams to collaborate on projects using Git.

Platform	Description
GitHub	Most popular Git hosting service. Owned by Microsoft.
GitLab	Offers both a hosted and self-hosted version. Strong CI/CD support.
Bitbucket	Popular in enterprise teams. Owned by Atlassian. Integrates well with Jira and Trello.
All three provide features like:

Repository hosting

Issue tracking

Pull/Merge requests

CI/CD pipelines

Access control and collaboration tools

git remote add origin <url>
This command is used to link your local repo to a remote repo for the first time.
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
origin is the default name for the remote. It could be any name, but "origin" is standard.

<url> is the connection string to the remote repository.

Example:
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/myproject.git
git remote -v
This command lists the remote repositories configured in your local repo.

Output Example:
origin  https://github.com/johndoe/myproject.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/johndoe/myproject.git (push)
It shows both fetch and push URLs for the remote named origin.

git push origin master
This command is used to push your local branch (master) to the remote repository (origin).

Syntax:
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
Example:
git push origin master
It sends your local master branch to the remote origin.

After this, others can see your code in the remote repo.

Bonus Tips:
To clone a remote repo:
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
To push all branches:
git push --all origin
To change remote URL later:
git remote set-url origin <new-url>
