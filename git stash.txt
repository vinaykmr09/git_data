What is Git Stashing?
git stash temporarily saves (or stashes) changes that you don’t want to commit yet. It’s useful when:

You're working on something half-done.

You want to switch branches.

But you don’t want to lose your changes or commit them yet.

Where do stashed changes go?
They go into a stash stack — you can later retrieve (pop/apply) them when you're ready.

Git Areas You Should Know:
Area	Description
Working Area	Where you edit files (git status shows changes here).
Staging Area	Where files go after git add (ready to be committed).
Committed	Files stored in Git history (git commit saves from staging to repository).
Stash	Temporary storage area where uncommitted changes can be stored and restored.
Common Stash Commands
git stash
Save your uncommitted (working directory + staged) changes:
git stash
Save with a message:
git stash save "WIP: frogs-and-ox"
View your stash list
git stash list
Sample output:
stash@{0}: WIP on frogs-and-ox: 6d8ab2d added opening paragraph
stash@{1}: WIP on story-index: fixed typo in title
Show the contents of a stash
git stash show stash@{0}
Add -p to see the diff:
git stash show -p stash@{1}
Apply & remove (pop) the latest stash
git stash pop
Apply & remove a specific stash
git stash pop stash@{1}
Real-world example:
You're working on a story about “The Frogs and the Ox” in a branch story/frogs-and-ox, but need to switch to master to fix a typo.

Stash current changes:
git stash
Switch to master, fix the typo, commit:
git checkout master
# Fix typo, then...
git add .
git commit -m "Fix typo in story index"
Switch back to your working branch:
git checkout story/frogs-and-ox
Restore stashed changes:
git stash pop
What is git reflog?
git reflog shows all changes to HEAD — including commits, resets, checkouts, etc.

Even if you did reset --hard, you can use git reflog to recover the lost commit.
git reflog
Example:
e2b7a87 HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
a1c4f20 HEAD@{1}: commit: add author info
Then you can restore lost commits:
git checkout a1c4f20
Git Porcelain vs Plumbing Commands
Git has two types of commands:

1. Porcelain Commands (for humans)
High-level, user-friendly commands you use daily.

Examples:

git status

git commit

git stash

git log

git add

git push

Think: clean interface like a porcelain sink.

2. Plumbing Commands (for scripting/internal use)
Low-level, detailed commands used in scripts or advanced Git tools.

Examples:

git cat-file

git hash-object

git update-ref

git rev-parse

Think: internal pipes behind the scenes.
